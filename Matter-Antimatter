-> Matter & Antimatter: From Nothing?

The idea that something can come from *nothing* is mind-breaking. But quantum physics suggests that even a vacuum isn’t truly empty — it’s buzzing with potential.

-> Particle–Antiparticle Pairs
In extreme conditions (like early universe or near black holes), energy can randomly fluctuate into a particle and its antimatter twin. Boom — matter and antimatter appear.

But here’s the mystery: we mostly see **matter** in the universe. So where did all the antimatter go?

-> My Thoughts
- If creation from nothing is possible, what decides the outcome?
- What if antimatter still exists — just in places we haven’t seen?
- Could we one day control this process to literally create particles?

- Pair production & annihilation
- Asymmetry in early universe (CP violation)
- Schwinger Effect (extreme fields pulling matter from vacuum)
