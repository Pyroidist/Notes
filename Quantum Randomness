-> Quantum Randomness

Quantum randomness is honestly one of the wildest ideas in physics. It's not just that we don’t *know* what outcome we'll get — it’s that nature itself doesn't “decide” until the moment we look. That blows my mind every time.

-> What's Going On?
In classical physics, randomness usually means we’re missing some info. Like flipping a coin — it *feels* random, but it’s all based on physics. Quantum mechanics? Nope. Even with *all* the info, you still can’t predict exactly what’s going to happen.

Take the double-slit experiment — you shoot one photon, and where it lands on the screen? Totally unpredictable. Do it a million times, and you’ll see a pattern. But each individual photon? Pure quantum chance.

-> My Thoughts
- Is the universe just rolling dice at the smallest scale?
- What if quantum randomness is the raw fabric of "free will"?
- Could we one day understand the *why* behind this randomness?
