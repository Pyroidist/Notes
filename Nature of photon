-> The Nature of a Photon

Photons are kind of magical. They have no rest mass. No electric charge. No “length.” They don’t even experience time — and yet, they *define* what we see.

-> Wait, What Is a Photon?
At its core, a photon is a tiny bundle of light energy. It moves at the speed of light, and always will. But here’s where it gets strange: depending on how we look at it, a photon can act like a wave *or* a particle.

It doesn't “choose” until we try to measure it. Until then, it's like it’s everywhere it could possibly be.

-> Something I’ve Been Thinking About
If photons don’t experience time, then... from their perspective, isn’t their entire journey instantaneous? Like, the moment a photon leaves a star and hits your eye, it didn’t “wait” billions of years. To the photon, it just happened.

That thought alone gives me goosebumps.

-> More Questions to Explore
- Do photons even “exist” in the way we think before we observe them?
- Could the way photons collapse reveal something about how the universe is stitched together?
- If they don’t decay, and time doesn’t pass for them, are all photons eternal?
