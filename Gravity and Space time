->  Gravity & The Spacetime Fabric

We used to think of gravity as just a force pulling things together. But then Einstein came along and flipped everything.

-> What It Really Is
Gravity isn’t really a force — it’s the result of how **mass bends spacetime**. Big objects like planets or stars curve the space around them, and other objects just *follow* those curves. Kinda like rolling a marble around a stretched trampoline.

-> Why It Feels So Sci-Fi
- Time actually ticks **slower** near heavier objects.
- Gravity is not “acting at a distance” — it’s local bending of reality itself.
- Without mass, there’s no curve — so no gravity.

-> Stuff I Wonder About
- Is gravity the weakest force because it spreads through extra dimensions?
- Can we bend spacetime in reverse — like artificially?
- If time is linked to space, is gravity secretly affecting our **conscious experience of time**?

-> To Dive Into
- Einstein's General Relativity
- LIGO & gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric!)
- Black holes as extreme spacetime distortions
